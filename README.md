# Data-Analysis-project-FCC---Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator

### Description
This project involves creating a Python function to calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a 3x3 matrix.

### Key Features
- Usage of **NumPy** for mathematical computations.
- Accepts a 9-element list and reshapes it into a 3x3 matrix.
- Returns a dictionary containing:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation

### Files
- `mean_var_std.py`: Python script implementing the function.
- `test_module.py`: Test cases for functionality.

### Example Input and Output
#### Input:
```python
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

#### Output:
```python
{
    'mean': [[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 4.0],
    'variance': [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.666, 0.666, 0.666], 6.666],
    'standard deviation': [[2.449, 2.449, 2.449], [0.816, 0.816, 0.816], 2.581]
}
```
